Amazon S3 Server-Side Encryption Support in iOS
################################################

The AWS Mobile SDK for iOS supports server-side encryption of Amazon S3 data. To learn more about server-side
encryption, see `PUT Object <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html>`_.

The following properties are available to configure the encryption:

* `SSECustomerAlgorithm <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSiOSSDK/latest/Classes/AWSS3ReplicateObjectOutput.html#//api/name/SSECustomerAlgorithm>`_
* `SSECustomerKey <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSiOSSDK/latest/Classes/AWSS3UploadPartRequest.html#//api/name/SSECustomerKey>`_
* `SSECustomerKeyMD5 <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSiOSSDK/latest/Classes/AWSS3PutObjectOutput.html#//api/name/SSECustomerKeyMD5>`_
* `AWSS3ServerSideEncryption <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSiOSSDK/latest/Constants/AWSS3ServerSideEncryption.html>`_

To use these properties, import the ``AWSSS3Model`` with the following statement.

    .. container:: option

        Swift
            .. code-block:: swift

                import AWSS3

        Objective-C
            .. code-block:: objc

                #import <AWSS3/AWSS3.h>

``SSECustomerAlgorithm`` is a property of ``AWSS3ReplicateObjectOutput``. If server-side encryption
with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header,
which confirms the encryption algorithm that was used. Currently, the only valid option is AES256. You can
access ``SSECustomerAlgorithm`` as follows.

    .. container:: option

        Swift
            .. code-block:: swift

                let replicateObjectOutput = AWSS3ReplicateObjectOutput()
                replicateObjectOutput?.sseCustomerAlgorithm = "mySseCustomerAlgorithm

        Objective-C
            .. code-block:: objc

                AWSS3ReplicateObjectOutput *replicateObjectOutput = [AWSS3ReplicateObjectOutput new];
                replicateObjectOutput.SSECustomerAlgorithm = @"mySseCustomerAlgorithm";

``SSECustomerKey``, a property of ``AWSS3UploadPartRequest``, specifies the customer-provided
encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to encrypting data. This value is used to store the object,
and is then discarded; Amazon doesn't store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for
use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.
This must be the same encryption key specified in the request to initiate a multipart upload. You
can access SSECustomerKey as follows.

    .. container:: option

        Swift
            .. code-block:: swift

                let uploadPartRequest = AWSS3UploadPartRequest()
                uploadPartRequest?.sseCustomerKey = "customerProvidedEncryptionKey"


        Objective-C
            .. code-block:: objc

                AWSS3UploadPartRequest *uploadPartRequest = [AWSS3UploadPartRequest new];
                uploadPartRequest.SSECustomerKey = @"customerProvidedEncryptionKey";

``SSECustomerKeyMD5`` is a property of ``AWSS3PutObjectOutput``. If server-side encryption
with a customer-provided encryption key is requested, the response will include this
header. The response provides round trip message integrity verification of the customer-provided
encryption key. You can access ``SSECustomerKeyMD5`` as follows.

    .. container:: option

        Swift
            .. code-block:: swift

                let objectOutput = AWSS3PutObjectOutput()
                // Access objectOutput?.sseCustomerKeyMD5 ...

        Objective-C
            .. code-block:: objc

                AWSS3PutObjectOutput *objectOutput = [AWSS3PutObjectOutput new];
                //Access objectOutput.SSECustomerKeyMD5 ...

``AWSS3ServerSideEncryption`` represents the encryption algorithm for storing an object in Amazon S3. You
can access it as follows.

    .. container:: option

        Swift
            .. code-block:: swift

                let objectOutput = AWSS3PutObjectOutput()
                // Access objectOutput?.sseCustomerKeyMD5 ...


        Objective-C
            .. code-block:: objc

                AWSS3ReplicateObjectOutput *replicateObjectOutput = [AWSS3ReplicateObjectOutput new];
                // Access replicateObjectOutput.serverSideEncryption ...
