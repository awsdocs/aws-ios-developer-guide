About Amazon Web Services
-------------------------

*Amazon Web Services* (AWS) is a collection of digital infrastructure services that developers can
leverage when developing their applications. The services include computing, storage, database, and
application synchronization (messaging and queuing). AWS uses a pay-as-you-go service model: you are
charged only for the services that you |mdash| or your applications |mdash| use. For new AWS users,
a free usage tier is available. On this tier, services are free below a certain level of usage. For
more information about AWS costs and the Free Tier, see `Use the AWS Free Tier`__.  To obtain an AWS
account, visit the `AWS home page`__ and click **Create a Free Account**.
