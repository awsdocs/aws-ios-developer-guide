AWS Mobile SDK for iOS
======================

Welcome to the *AWS Mobile SDK for iOS Developer Guide*. This guide will help you start
developing iOS applications using Amazon Web Services.

If you're new to the AWS Mobile SDK, you'll probably want to look first at :doc:`Welcome`
and :doc:`getting-started-ios`. These topics explain what the AWS Mobile SDK includes, how
to set up the SDK, and how to get started using AWS services from an iOS application.

After you've set up the SDK, you can start working with the mobile clients for Amazon Web
Services. The mobile clients are described in the service-specific topics. No matter which
services you're using, you should provide AWS credentials to your app via Amazon Cognito.
The Amazon Cognito credential provider is discussed briefly in the various mobile service
topics, and at length in :doc:`cognito-auth-aws-identity-for-ios`.
