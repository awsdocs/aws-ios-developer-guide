|lamlong|_ (|lam|) is a compute service where you can upload your code to |lam| and the service can
run the code on your behalf using AWS infrastructure. After you upload your code and create what we
call a *Lambda function*, |lam| takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to
run the code. For complete information about |lam|, visit the |lam-dg|_.
