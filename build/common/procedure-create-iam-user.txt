.. topic:: To create an IAM user

    #.  Go to the :console:`IAM console <iam>` (you may need to sign in to AWS first).

    #.  Click :guilabel:`Users` in the sidebar to view your IAM users.

    #.  If you don't have any IAM users set up, click :guilabel:`Create New Users` to create one.

    #.  Select the IAM user in the list that you'll use to access AWS.

    #.  Open the :guilabel:`Security Credentials` tab, and click :guilabel:`Create Access Key`.

        .. note:: You can have a maximum of two active access keys for any given IAM user. If your IAM
            user has two access keys already, then you'll need to delete one of them before creating a
            new key.

    #.  On the resulting dialog box, click the :guilabel:`Download Credentials` button to download the
        credential file to your computer, or click :guilabel:`Show User Security Credentials` to view
        the IAM user's access key ID and secret access key (which you can copy and paste).

        .. important:: There is no way to obtain the secret access key once you close the dialog box. You
            can, however, delete its associated access key ID and create a new one.
