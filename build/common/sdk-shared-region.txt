   This file explains how to set a shared AWS Region for the AWS SDKs and the
   AWS CLI.

   To use it, add a line such as the following to your topic:

   .. include:: common/sdk-shared-region.txt

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Set the AWS Region in the AWS config file on your local system, located at:

    * |aws-configfile-loc-unixes| on |unixes|
    * |aws-configfile-loc-windows| on Windows

    This file should contain lines in the following format:

    .. code-block:: cfg

       [default]
       region = your_aws_region

    Substitute your desired AWS Region (for example, "us-west-2") for *your_aws_region*.

* Set the :envvar:`AWS_REGION` environment variable.

    On |unixes|, use :command:`export`:

    .. code-block:: sh

       export AWS_REGION=your_aws_region

    On Windows, use :command:`set`:

    .. code-block:: bat

       set AWS_REGION=your_aws_region

    Where *your_aws_region* is the desired AWS Region name.
