|EC2| *spot instances* allow you to bid on spare EC2 computing capacity. Since spot instances are
often available at a discount compared to on-demand pricing, you can significantly reduce the cost
of running your applications, grow your applicationâ€™s compute capacity and throughput for the same
budget, and enable new types of cloud computing applications.
