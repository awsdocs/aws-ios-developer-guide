.. admonition:: Best Practice

    We recommend that you enable the :s3-api:`AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload
    <RESTBucketPUTlifecycle>` lifecycle rule on your |S3| buckets.

    This rule directs |S3| to abort multipart uploads that don't complete within a specified number of days
    after being initiated. When the set time limit is exceeded, |S3| aborts the upload and then
    deletes the incomplete upload data.

    For more information, see :s3-ug:`Lifecycle Configuration for a Bucket with Versioning
    <lifecycle-configuration-bucket-with-versioning>` in the |s3-ug|.
